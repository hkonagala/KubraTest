# KubraTest

1. I used a custom list view adapter to display the users list and the AsyncTask is used o get the list of users.
2. I created a onClickListener to each user and getting the user id and sending that as intent extra to a new activity where all the posts of that user is retrieved as similar to 1.
3 & 4. Were not clear at before, still experimenting.
5. Done by adding a button at the top of the list and toggling between ascending and descending mode. By default the list will be unsorted.
